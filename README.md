 Kindle Paperwhite Lightfix
============================
This patch allows user to turn off the frontlight completely.

 Install/Uninstall
-------------------
Nothing fancy, as usual, with a jailbroken Kindle, just use the appropriate update file:
copy it to the Kindle's USB drive's root, then launch it by going to [Menu] -> Settings -> [Menu] -> Update Your Kindle.

 Usage
-------

Just set brightness to lowest level and the frontlight will be turned off after one minute or less.
